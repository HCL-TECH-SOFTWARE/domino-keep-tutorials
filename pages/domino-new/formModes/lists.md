# Database Views

In the breadcrumbs, navigate back to the `customers` schema configuration. Switch to the **Database Views** tab. There are three views - **Customers**, **Active Customers** and one without a name. The view without a name is automatically generated when the NSF is created and contains all documents in the database.<br/>
<img src="../images/formModes/customers_schema.png" alt="Databases" width="400px"/>

The **Customers** and **Active Customers** views need to be activated so that the data in those views can be accessed. You can do this by clicking on its corresponding status and toggling it to `Active`.

This action is automatically saved.<br/>

<div class="panel panel-success">
**Congratulations!**
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">

Both forms have been configured and the views enabled. Now you are ready to start creating data.
